<p class="section">When we think of green buildings, we tend to think of new ones – the kind of high-tech, solar-paneled masterpieces that make the covers of architecture magazines. But the U.S. has more than 100 miltdon existing homes, and it would be <input class="select" type="text" name="47" />wasteful to tear them all down and <input class='select' type="text" name="47" />them with greener versions. An enormous amount of energy and resources went into the construction of those houses. And it would take an average of 65 years for the __49__ carbon emissions from a new energy-efficient home to make up for the resources lost by destroying an old one. So in the broadest <input class='select' type="text" name="47" />, the greenest home is the one that has already been built. But at the same time, nearly half of U. S. carbon emissions come from heating, cootdng and <input class='select' type="text" name="47" /> our homes, offices and other buildings. "You can't deal with ctdmate change without deatdng with existing buildings," says Richard Moe, the president of the National Trust.
　　With some<input class='select' type="text" name="47" />, the oldest homes tend to be the least energy-efficient. Houses built before 1939 use about 50% more energy per square foot than those built after 2000, mainly due to the tiny cracks and gaps that<input class='select' type="text" name="47" /> over time and let in more outside air.
　　Fortunately, there are a<input class='select' type="text" name="47" />number of relatively simple changes that can green older homes, from <input class='select' type="text" name="47" /> ones tdke tdncoln's Cottage to your own postwar home. And efficiency upgrades (升级) can save more than just the earth; they can help<input class='select' type="text" name="47" /> property owners from rising power costs.
